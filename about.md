Hello, everyone!

Welcome to my website!

Let me start with an introduction of myself.

I'm a medical student from China but also highly motivated in computer programming. I am familier with `HTML` , `Javascript` , `CSS` , `PHP` and `Python`. Beside that, I am also a huge fan of **Cognitive Science** and **Neurobiology**.

What makes me really different from most medical students is that ***I'm trying to use computer programming to hack into our brain***, especially the part of the brain that involves in the **learning process**.

It occurred to me when I was still in my first or second year of medical school. The sheer volume of material I needed to remember overwhelmed me, and it became worse when it comes to final exams.

So, I started combing through piles of literature for help. I began to notice some keywords like **Spaced Reptition**, **Active Recall**, **Testing Effect** etc. These are actually terminology borrowed from *Psychology*, and have been involved in scientific research for quite a long time. However, it wasn't until recently that these findings began stepping into our daily life.

The most prominent progress of *memory and learning* is the introduction of ***SuperMemo*** (an algorithm and a software for memory consolidation based on flashcards). Actually, I have been using ***Anki*** (a software based on ***SM-2*** algorithm) since 2014 when I was still in high school, without realizing the learning theory behind it.

To make the process of making flashcards easier, I began using `Python` to assist in the process since last year. I am also trying to recognize different types of learning materials and to figure out the most efficient learning process for each.

This website is intended to show some of my recent activities on my work, i.e., ***using `Python` to assist in the learning process***.

If you're also interested in ***coding*** and ***learning theory***, please feel free to contact me.
